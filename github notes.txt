Even how they speak is extremely important.
“It’s simple and fun. I like it.”

Short

Non-analytical

Outcome-focused

Inference:

Intuitive decision maker

Trusts feelings

Evaluates quickly


Moments explain preferences better than personalities.


If you don’t like Candy Crush:

Don’t clone Candy Crush

Design something you respect

Find users who share your cognitive style.

SO I THINK IT'S COGNITIVE STYLE. UNDERSTAND THEM AND TRY TO EXPERIMENT WITH THEM.


What problem does this solve
Candy Crush solves:

boredom

mental fatigue

anxiety

waiting discomfort

lack of control


IS IT SOLVING PROBLEMS OR IS WHAT PEOPLE LIKE. WHEN PEOPLE PLAY THIS GAME, WHAT DO THEY GET FROM IT.



SEE ANOTHER ONE :  

Why you don't like Candy Crush ? 

You:
enjoy depth and understanding

dislike shallow reward loops

want meaning or learning

get bored by repetition without insight

So Candy Crush feels:

empty

mechanical

uninteresting

That’s a valid cognitive preference




cognitive styles / thinking modes — recurring ways people process information, make decisions, and seek satisfaction.





Verify this one for me because it's kind of true :  

1. Analytical / System Thinkers

Core question: “How does this work?”

How they think

Break things into parts

Care about logic, consistency, rules

Prefer explanations over vibes

Notice contradictions quickly

What they value

Clarity

Depth

Fair systems

Predictability

Likely behaviors

Enjoy strategy games, simulations, puzzles

Read instructions or reviews carefully

Get frustrated by randomness or “fake difficulty”

May dislike overly flashy UI

Risks

Overthinking

Paralysis by analysis

Bored by simple reward loops



This is also true. eg Larweh

2. Intuitive / Feeling-Based Thinkers

Core question: “How does this feel?”

How they think

Make fast, gut-based judgments

Trust emotional responses

Hard to explain why they like something

Experience-first, explanation later

What they value

Comfort

Flow

Emotional resonance

Aesthetic pleasure

Likely behaviors

Enjoy casual games (e.g., Candy Crush)

Choose based on vibe, not specs

Use apps without reading instructions

Prefer smooth, friendly interfaces

Risks

Can be manipulated by shallow rewards

May struggle to articulate preferences



This was from the comment on playstore.
Tom repeats everything you say in a hilarious voice that never fails to make me laugh. - normal things in life like OJO that makes people laugh -

 MY EXPLANATION IS THAT : THE ANTICIPATION IS THE ONE THAT CREATED THE ENJOYMENT.

feeding Tom, playing mini-games, exploring adventures, and customizing his look

LOVE THIS : Take care of Talking Tom by feeding him, making sure he gets enough sleep, and keeping him happy.  - there are some activities we have imagined we want to do to and it comes from anticipation of adulthood and that has created the interest. it's kind of called delayed gratification. you are delaying the interest.

Feed Talking Tom his favorite food and watch his reactions.
Help him brush his teeth and use the bathroom. Make sure he gets enough sleep
DO YOU KNOW WHY FEEDING BABY IS SWEET BECAUSE WE WANT TO WATCH THEIR REACTION. SAME THING WITH WHAT THE USER IS SAYING.
AND AS I SAID IT'S THE ANTICIPATION THAT HAS MADE US LOVE FEEDING BABIES. IT'S NOT IN OUR TRAIT. IT'S ANTICIPATION, SEE MAKE SURE HE GETS ENOUGH SLEEP.

THE REASON WHY PEOPLE LIKE THE GAME IS THAT YOU TAKE CARE OF PETS AND ITS ROOT IS FROM THE ANTICIPATION THAT WE WILL GROW AND THAT PLEASURE HAS BEEN DELAYED CREATING HAPPINESS.


HAVE YOU SEEN AGAIN, WHO THE HELL WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF AN ADULT ? 
THIS IS A REVIEW.
The Game Becomes Annoying As Hell After They Removed Free Baby Potion. Now You Have To Pay To Get A Baby Potion. Which Is Very Annoying. Playing With The Adult Version Of Tom Is Very Boring, And He Also Becomes Very Rude When He Is Adult. The Baby Size Of The Tom Is Very Cute, Adorable, And Fun To Play.

DO YOU KNOW WHY MY GAME WILL WORK. I TOLD YOU IT GIVES DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW IT WILL... DELAYED GRATIFICATION.



WHY THE ENGLISH APP WILL WORK ? 
NETNINJA, NOBODY LIKED RULE BASED CHATBOT BUT NOW THEY LIKE THE ABILITY TO THINK ON THEIR OWN -> THEY WILL LIKE IT EVEN IF IT'S NEW BECAUSE THEY LIKED CHATGTP.
